Goal: predict number of future cases for area/nation/world

step 1. gather as many relevant features as possible. these can include

• non time dependent numerics (gdp education level etc)

• non time dependent categoricals (idk)

• time series (past cases over time)

step 2. look at correlations / variable importance of these on cases at a given time

step 3. build model with these variables (or maybe step 2 and 3 could be same step)

step 4. do inference to predict future
