Goal: predict number of future cases for area/nation/world

1. gather as many relevant features as possible. these can include
- non time dependent numerics (gdp education level etc)
- non time dependent categoricals (idk)
- time series (past cases over time)
2. look at correlations / variable importance of these on cases at a given time
3. build model with these variables (or maybe step 2 and 3 could be same step)
4. do inference to predict future
